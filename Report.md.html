This is report of the Graphics Codex Project Rays

Here Map Theory to implementation
===================================

Design Decisions
------------------

Observations about Algorithms
-------------------------------

Gotchas
---------

Test Renders to demonstrate correctness (640 x 400 losless PNG)
=================================================================

“G3D Triangle” scene without indirect light
---------------------------------------------

“G3D Cornell Box” scene without indirect light
-----------------------------------------------

A scene with analytic spheres and triangles
---------------------------------------------

“G3D Cornell Box” scene with 2048 indirect light rays
-------------------------------------------------------

“G3D Sponza” scene with no indirect light at 640×400
-----------------------------------------------------
Time taken to render the image: 

Custom scene with some requirements (see Report Spec)
------------------------------------------------------

Graphs of Running Time vs 5 major params
============================================

Number of cores: 1 vs multithreading (2 in my case :P)
---------------------------------------------------------

Number of triangles in the scene (1 vs 10 vs 100 vs 1000...)
----------------------------------------------------------------

Number of pixels in the image (1, 64^2, 128^2...)
------------------------------------------------------

Number of lights (1, 6, 20, 100)
-----------------------------------

Number of Indirect Rays (0, 1, 10, 100, 1000, 2000)
-----------------------------------------------------

Theoretical asymptotic bound for this renderer based on above factors
======================================================================

Questions
==========

1. How would you derive an analytic intersection algorithm for a finite right cylinder? Do not actually do so.
Ans:

2. How would compute the intersection with a surface for which there was no analytic intersection solution? For example, an arbitrary continuous height function y(x,z). Sketch an algorithm, but do not attempt to refine it.
Ans:

3. How do you think a binary tree could be leveraged to accelerate the ray intersection process? If you choose to research this (not required) before answering, be sure to cite the resources that you consult.
Ans:

Self-Evaluations
=================

Describe and Categorize learnings
===================================
Distinguish software engineering, algorithmic, and mathematical skills. Include the reading and ideas that you had to implicitly work through even if not required.

Time spent on the project
==========================
Exclude time spent on the required reading and when the computer was rendering unattended
Distinguish required minimum time to complete the specification from polishing time.
